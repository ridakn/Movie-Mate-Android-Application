# Movie-Mate-Android-Application

By Xiaopu Cheng, Rida Khan, Rajas Purohit

Movie mate is an android application which recommends movies to users. Users can swipe through movie recommendations, add movies to lists and like, dislike movies as well. The recommendations will change based on the movies the user likes and dislikes. Our aim was to create an application that will act as a movie recommender to the user. Each user can create an account with login details. Once theyâ€™ve created an account, they are able to select movies they like, want to watch and make lists accordingly. The user information is stored in a database. Users can also search for movies based on keywords.
